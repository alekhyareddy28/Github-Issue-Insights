"Improve heading spacing on Markdown preview","The spacing on markdown preview has headings (h2,h3) in the middle between text, but they should be spaced less with the content underneath so it looks like a section. Right now the spacing looks even with the content below and above.\r\n\r\nHere is an example (using grey matter theme):\r\n<img width=\"676\" alt=\"markdown-preview\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/936006/87095255-50561f80-c238-11ea-8bcf-c4c2f023c3c1.png\">\r\n\r\nI've adjusted on photoshop what it should look like:\r\n<img width=\"676\" alt=\"markdown-preview (1)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/936006/87095426-a034e680-c238-11ea-9897-b661e828630d.png\">\r\n\r\nIt's only slight but the bottom one brings the heading down slightly so its more together.\r\nI looked into doing this but i could only find https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/06f85af581281a3f45783329d375ecc7694930b4/extensions/markdown-language-features/media/markdown.css\r\n\r\n@mjbvz","help wanted,insiders-released,markdown,verification-needed","fix styling to improve heading spacing fixes #102036","This PR fixes #102036\r\n\r\n- So the first issue is that most elements have a margin-top and margin-bottom.\r\nIt made sense to remove the margin-top and let top elements push others down. (otherwise you fall into margin-collapse hell)\r\n- This means the body needs a padding on the top so that any first element has a gap (and not just the H1)\r\n- Headings have a smaller bottom margin so as to look more like a section\r\n- If 2 paragraphs are next to each other, the second paragraph reduces its top margin to bring them closer together.\r\n\r\n## Before\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/936006/87351758-ce286c80-c551-11ea-80e5-13af706cd8ac.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## After\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/936006/87352076-5d358480-c552-11ea-9fa0-c5fcf3861712.png)\r\n\r\npings @mjbvz \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Modified `ResultCollection` data structure to support the bulk adding of results. This reduces the number of `NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs` events argument to one per query from one per result item. \r\n2. Moved Result modification/adding/removing to a background thread. \r\n3.
