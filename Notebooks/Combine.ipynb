Please describe.**\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a user triggers a sync (i.e. via a listStatus) on a large directory and the sync takes an extended period of time, then the user might be inclined to ctrl-C to cancel the RPC and issue it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with this now is that the metadata sync will continue to run on the master until completion. Only after completion will the handler eventually run into an error when returning the RPC response.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine syncing a large directory that creates > 1M files. This will consume a large swath of CPU for some period of time. Depending on the hardware configuration, this can be a _long_ time. If the user cancels the RPC, then it should interrupt the metadata sync which should allow more operations\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you\\'d like**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution itself is straightforward. Each RPC is associated with an `OperationContext<T>` - the context has a method `isCancelled` which will return whether the RPC issued by the user has been cancelled for one or more reasons (user, network, etc..). It uses the underlying gRPC `StreamObserver#isCancelled` method.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a metadata sync we should be able to provide an `OperationContext` and periodically check the `isCancelled` on the operation to see if we should continue syncing.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you\\'ve considered**\\r\\n\\r\\nNone at the moment. The proposed solutions seems like a simple and straightforward implementation with few, if any, downsides. The only argument I could see against this is that someone wants a \"fire-and-forget\" implementation for syncing where they can issue an `ls`, cancel the command, and continue using their terminal while the sync runs. In that case, the user would just never know when the sync is finished - but they would at least know that it was started.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Urgency**\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevent over-utilization on the master that doesn\\'t benefit any client operation.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nN/A\\r\\n',\n",

       "  u'One of the listed use cases for `workspace.exclude` in the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html) is for when you are \"using a glob pattern and you want to remove a directory\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is very handy, and lets `workspace.members` stay pretty clean if your project structure is *mostly* consistent. Unfortunately it isn\\'t similarly supported by `workspace.default-members`, which *must* be a strict subset of `workspace.members`. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo see what I mean, here\\'s an example I hit recently (this is based on the project layout of https://github.com/mozilla/application-services -- but simplified).\\r\\n\\r\\nEssentially, I think something like the following code should work:\\r\\n\\r\\n```toml\\r\\n[workspace]\\r\\nmembers = [\\r\\n    \"components/*\",\\r\\n    \"components/support/*\",\\r\\n    \"tools/i-compile-very-slowly-and-am-rarely-needed\",\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n# Exclude a couple things that the globs in `workspace.members` catch\\r\\n# overeagerly\\r\\nexclude = [\\r\\n    # This is not a crate, and just contains support and utility code.\\r\\n    \"components/support\",\\r\\n    # Android support code (this is in Kotlin, not Rust)\\r\\n    \"components/support/android\",\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n# Everything except `tools/i-compile-very-slowly-and-am-rarely-needed`\\r\\ndefault-members = [\\r\\n    \"components/*\",\\r\\n    \"components/support/*\",\\r\\n]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if you try this, you get errors like \"`<project>/components/support/android` is listed in workspace\\u2019s default-members but is not a member\", because \"When specified, default-members must expand to a subset of members.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n### Possible solution\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that rule makes sense, and can help catch bugs, so I\\'m not saying it should be removed or weakened. I think my issue can be fixed by just tweaking the way that rule is implemented rather than removing it:\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of checking that `workspace.default-members` is a subset of `(workspace.members - workspace.exclude)` (which is what cargo does now), cargo should check that `default-members` is a subset of `members`.\\r\\n\\r\\nConceptually, I think this is really just a change of *when* the check happens -- e.g. IMO it should happen prior to applying exclude to members, as opposed to afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Of course, I think you will also need to apply `workspace.exclude` to `workspace.default-members` to produce the computed set of default members, but that\\'s easy and if the above holds, it shouldn\\'t remove anything from it except what was removed from `workspace.members`)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, thanks for your time.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. Sorry that this doesn\\'t fit an issue template. I wrote it out in a text editor first to make sure it made sense, but now it\\'s hard to adapt and I don\\'t really have time to rewrite it. Let me know if you need any clarification.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, since it\\'s kinda halfway between bug and feature request, the template didn\\'t really made tons of sense, I think.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m also sorry that the issue title is not very descriptive.\\r\\n',\n",

       "  u\"\\U0001f44b! I gave a first pass to the code and I'm happy! I can easily read it follow what's going on in the app.\\r\\n\\r\\nI noticed that most of the logic lives inside the `Index` component. While this works, it makes hard to eventually reuse some of that logic in other, possible future, parts of the application. I think the code can be split based on its purpose. Here's a (vague) list of categories you can use\\r\\n\\r\\n- **UI code**: the code that renders the interface.\\r\\n- **state code**: the code that holds and handles the data for the UI.\\r\\n- **retrieval code**: the code that brings the data from some external entity and makes it consumable for the app. On web this is usually code that calls an API, but it can also obtain the data from `localStorage` or cookies.\\r\\n- **piping code**: code that puts everything together (i.e. calls retrieval code and gives the result to the state code).\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing these categories helps to decide what code should live in an independent module and what should be closer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, [this block](https://github.com/afgomez/news-feed/blob/master/frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx#L56-L122) is mostly network code. I think it can be extracted into its own function and then call that function from within `Index`.\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsx\\r\\n// api/news.ts\\r\\nexport async function fetchNews(searchTerm, aggregations): Promise<{ ... }> {\\r\\n  return fetch(\\r\\n    `${process.env.REACT_APP_ELASTIC_SERVICE_URL}/search?search=${search}`,\\r\\n    {\\r\\n      method: 'POST',\\r\\n      body: JSON.stringify({ aggs: selectedAggs }),\\r\\n      headers: {\\r\\n        'Content-type': 'application/json',\\r\\n      },\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  ).then(() => {\\r\\n    /*\\r\\n     * Transform ES response into something the app can use\\r\\n     * maybe something like.\\r\\n     * {\\r\\n     *   news: {\\r\\n     *     items: [...],\\r\\n     *     categories: [...],\\r\\n     *     dates: [...],\\r\\n     *     ...\\r\\n     *   }\\r\\n     * }\\r\\n     */\\r\\n  });\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n```tsx\\r\\n// pages/Index.tsx\\r\\nimport { fetchNews } from '../api/news';\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Index() {\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n\\r\\n  const onSuggestionSelected = (search: string): void => {\\r\\n    setSearchValue(search);\\r\\n    fetchNews(search, selectedAggs).then(({ news, videos, ...}) => {\\r\\n      /* Pipe the data onto the state */\\r\\n    })\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThat way is easier to potentially reuse the `fetchNews` in different parts, or make other refactorings possible. Imagine you want to fetch only the news, or only the videos. You could easily add a third optional parameter to do so, whereas with the current code it will be harder to do so (IMO).\",\n",

Request Board](https://boards.invertase.io/react-native-firebase).\\r\\n2) For questions and support please use our Discord chat: https://discord.gg/C9aK28N or Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native-firebase\\r\\n3) If this is a setup issue then please make sure you\\'ve correctly followed the setup guides, most setup issues such as \\'duplicate dex files\\', \\'default app has not been initialized\\' etc are all down to an incorrect setup as the guides haven\\'t been correctly followed.\\r\\n-->\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- NOTE: You can change any of the `[ ]` to `[x]` to mark an option(s) as selected -->\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE ANY SECTIONS FROM THIS ISSUE TEMPLATE   -->\\r\\n<!--   Leave them as they are even if they\\'re irrelevant to your issue -->\\r\\n\\r\\n## Issue\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- Please describe your issue here --^ and provide as much detail as you can. -->\\r\\n<!-- Include code snippets that show your usages of the library in the context of your project. -->\\r\\n<!-- Snippets that also show how and where the library is imported in JS are useful to debug issues relating to importing or methods not found issues -->\\r\\n\\r\\nI installed the performance monitoring module into our application, it works fine and reports to firebase, but sometimes it the app crashes.\\r\\nAnd the issue was `Collection <__NSDictionaryM: 0x600002b7e1c0> was mutated while being enumerated`\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked into it and read the error reports, it seemed like the function `dealloc` in `RNFBPerfModule.m` was causing the issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34472701/83610592-5cd7c000-a588-11ea-939a-3a76f3606403.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I did was, I changed the `dealloc` function to this:\\r\\n```diff\\r\\n   - (void)dealloc {\\r\\n     @synchronized ([self class]) {\\r\\n-      for (NSString *key in traces) {\\r\\n+      for (NSString *key in [traces allKeys]) {\\r\\n         [traces removeObjectForKey:key];\\r\\n       }\\r\\n \\r\\n-      for (NSString *key in httpMetrics) {\\r\\n+      for (NSString *key in [httpMetrics allKeys]) {\\r\\n         [httpMetrics removeObjectForKey:key];\\r\\n       }\\r\\n     }\\r\\n```\\r\\nreference: https://coderwall.com/p/qsty1w/safely-remove-nsmutabledictionary-objects-in-a-loop\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m not an experienced iOS developer, so I don\\'t know if that\\'s a good solution or not, but it worked for me and since I changed the code, the app didn\\'t crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf that\\'s a good solution, I\\'d be happy to send a PR.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Project Files\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- Provide the contents of key project files which will help to debug -->\\r\\n<!--     For Example: -->\\r\\n<!--

It\\'s been very valuable to me in these trying times and has enabled me to continue to work from home using my preferred platform; thanks to @mrbaseman for the port to FreeBSD.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I\\'ve been experiencing, through my daily use of the VPN, intermittent/random tunnel closures, usually with a message like \"ERROR: write: Bad address\".

This will consume a large swath of CPU for some period of time. Depending on the hardware configuration, this can be a _long_ time. If the user cancels the RPC, then it should interrupt the metadata sync which should allow more operations\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Describe the solution you\\\\\\'d like**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe solution itself is straightforward. Each RPC is associated with an `OperationContext<T>` - the context has a method `isCancelled` which will return whether the RPC issued by the user has been cancelled for one or more reasons (user, network, etc..). It uses the underlying gRPC `StreamObserver#isCancelled` method.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWithin a metadata sync we should be able to provide an `OperationContext` and periodically check the `isCancelled` on the operation to see if we should continue syncing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Describe alternatives you\\\\\\'ve considered**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNone at the moment. The proposed solutions seems like a simple and straightforward implementation with few, if any, downsides. The only argument I could see against this is that someone wants a \"fire-and-forget\" implementation for syncing where they can issue an `ls`, cancel the command, and continue using their terminal while the sync runs. In that case, the user would just never know when the sync is finished - but they would at least know that it was started.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Urgency**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPrevent over-utilization on the master that doesn\\\\\\'t benefit any client operation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n**Additional context**\\\\r\\\\nN/A\\\\r\\\\n',\n",

       "  'One of the listed use cases for `workspace.exclude` in the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html) is for when you are \"using a glob pattern and you want to remove a directory\".\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis is very handy, and lets `workspace.members` stay pretty clean if your project structure is *mostly* consistent. Unfortunately it isn\\\\\\'t similarly supported by `workspace.default-members`, which *must* be a strict subset of `workspace.members`. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo see what I mean, here\\\\\\'s an example I hit recently (this is based on the project layout of https://github.com/mozilla/application-services -- but simplified).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEssentially, I think something like the following code should work:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n```toml\\\\r\\\\n[workspace]\\\\r\\\\nmembers = [\\\\r\\\\n    \"components/*\",\\\\r\\\\n    \"components/support/*\",\\\\r\\\\n    \"tools/i-compile-very-slowly-and-am-rarely-needed\",\\\\r\\\\n]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n# Exclude a couple things that the globs in `workspace.members` catch\\\\r\\\\n# overeagerly\\\\r\\\\nexclude = [\\\\r\\\\n    # This is not a crate, and just contains support and utility code.\\\\r\\\\n    \"components/support\",\\\\r\\\\n    # Android support code (this is in Kotlin, not Rust)\\\\r\\\\n    \"components/support/android\",\\\\r\\\\n]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n# Everything except `tools/i-compile-very-slowly-and-am-rarely-needed`\\\\r\\\\ndefault-members = [\\\\r\\\\n    \"components/*\",\\\\r\\\\n    \"components/support/*\",\\\\r\\\\n]\\\\r\\\\n```\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHowever, if you try this, you get errors like \"`<project>/components/support/android` is listed in workspace\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s default-members but is not a member\", because \"When specified, default-members must expand to a subset of members.\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n### Possible solution\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI think that rule makes sense, and can help catch bugs, so I\\\\\\'m not saying it should be removed or weakened. I think my issue can be fixed by just tweaking the way that rule is implemented rather than removing it:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInstead of checking that `workspace.default-members` is a subset of `(workspace.members - workspace.exclude)` (which is what cargo does now), cargo should check that `default-members` is a subset of `members`.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConceptually, I think this is really just a change of *when* the check happens -- e.g. IMO it should happen prior to applying exclude to members, as opposed to afterwards.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n(Of course, I think you will also need to apply `workspace.exclude` to `workspace.default-members` to produce the computed set of default members, but that\\\\\\'s easy and if the above holds, it shouldn\\\\\\'t remove anything from it except what was removed from `workspace.members`)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnyway, thanks for your time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n---\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nP.S. Sorry that this doesn\\\\\\'t fit an issue template. I wrote it out in a text editor first to make sure it made sense, but now it\\\\\\'s hard to adapt and I don\\\\\\'t really have time to rewrite it. Let me know if you need any clarification.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlso, since it\\\\\\'s kinda halfway between bug and feature request, the template didn\\\\\\'t really made tons of sense, I think.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI\\\\\\'m also sorry that the issue title is not very descriptive.\\\\r\\\\n',\n",

I can easily read it follow what\\\\'s going on in the app.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI noticed that most of the logic lives inside the `Index` component. While this works, it makes hard to eventually reuse some of that logic in other, possible future, parts of the application. I think the code can be split based on its purpose. Here\\\\'s a (vague) list of categories you can use\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n- **UI code**: the code that renders the interface.\\\\r\\\\n- **state code**: the code that holds and handles the data for the UI.\\\\r\\\\n- **retrieval code**: the code that brings the data from some external entity and makes it consumable for the app. On web this is usually code that calls an API, but it can also obtain the data from `localStorage` or cookies.\\\\r\\\\n- **piping code**: code that puts everything together (i.e. calls retrieval code and gives the result to the state code).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUsing these categories helps to decide what code should live in an independent module and what should be closer.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor example, [this block](https://github.com/afgomez/news-feed/blob/master/frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx#L56-L122) is mostly network code. I think it can be extracted into its own function and then call that function from within `Index`.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n```tsx\\\\r\\\\n// api/news.ts\\\\r\\\\nexport async function fetchNews(searchTerm, aggregations): Promise<{ ... }> {\\\\r\\\\n  return fetch(\\\\r\\\\n    `${process.env.REACT_APP_ELASTIC_SERVICE_URL}/search?search=${search}`,\\\\r\\\\n    {\\\\r\\\\n      method: \\\\'POST\\\\',\\\\r\\\\n      body: JSON.stringify({ aggs: selectedAggs }),\\\\r\\\\n      headers: {\\\\r\\\\n        \\\\'Content-type\\\\': \\\\'application/json\\\\',\\\\r\\\\n      },\\\\r\\\\n    }\\\\r\\\\n  ).then(() => {\\\\r\\\\n    /*\\\\r\\\\n     * Transform ES response into something the app can use\\\\r\\\\n     * maybe something like.\\\\r\\\\n     * {\\\\r\\\\n     *   news: {\\\\r\\\\n     *     items: [...],\\\\r\\\\n     *     categories: [...],\\\\r\\\\n     *     dates: [...],\\\\r\\\\n     *     ...\\\\r\\\\n     *   }\\\\r\\\\n     * }\\\\r\\\\n     */\\\\r\\\\n  });\\\\r\\\\n}\\\\r\\\\n```\\\\r\\\\n```tsx\\\\r\\\\n// pages/Index.tsx\\\\r\\\\nimport { fetchNews } from \\\\'../api/news\\\\';\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nfunction Index() {\\\\r\\\\n  // ...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  const onSuggestionSelected = (search: string): void => {\\\\r\\\\n    setSearchValue(search);\\\\r\\\\n    fetchNews(search, selectedAggs).then(({ news, videos, ...}) => {\\\\r\\\\n      /* Pipe the data onto the state */\\\\r\\\\n    })\\\\r\\\\n  }\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  // ...\\\\r\\\\n}\\\\r\\\\n```\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThat way is easier to potentially reuse the `fetchNews` in different parts, or make other refactorings possible. Imagine you want to fetch only the news, or only the videos. You could easily add a third optional parameter to do so, whereas with the current code it will be harder to do so (IMO).\",\n",

application, it works fine and reports to firebase, but sometimes it the app crashes.\\\\r\\\\nAnd the issue was `Collection <__NSDictionaryM: 0x600002b7e1c0> was mutated while being enumerated`\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI looked into it and read the error reports, it seemed like the function `dealloc` in `RNFBPerfModule.m` was causing the issue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34472701/83610592-5cd7c000-a588-11ea-939a-3a76f3606403.png)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat I did was, I changed the `dealloc` function to this:\\\\r\\\\n```diff\\\\r\\\\n   - (void)dealloc {\\\\r\\\\n     @synchronized ([self class]) {\\\\r\\\\n-      for (NSString *key in traces) {\\\\r\\\\n+      for (NSString *key in [traces allKeys]) {\\\\r\\\\n         [traces removeObjectForKey:key];\\\\r\\\\n       }\\\\r\\\\n \\\\r\\\\n-      for (NSString *key in httpMetrics) {\\\\r\\\\n+      for (NSString *key in [httpMetrics allKeys]) {\\\\r\\\\n         [httpMetrics removeObjectForKey:key];\\\\r\\\\n       }\\\\r\\\\n     }\\\\r\\\\n```\\\\r\\\\nreference: https://coderwall.com/p/qsty1w/safely-remove-nsmutabledictionary-objects-in-a-loop\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI\\\\\\'m not an experienced iOS developer, so I don\\\\\\'t know if that\\\\\\'s a good solution or not, but it worked for me and since I changed the code, the app didn\\\\\\'t crash.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf that\\\\\\'s a good solution, I\\\\\\'d be happy to send a
